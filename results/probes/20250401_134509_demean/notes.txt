# Title: Demeaning the probes
# Experiment description: First have to identify the average activations across a large dataset. Then need to subtract this from the probe.
## Run 0: Baseline
Results: Baseline results is we achieve about 10% accuracy on the test set, using basic probe.
Description: Baseline results.

## Run 1: Basic Demeaning
Results: Pending
Description: Implemented basic demeaning by subtracting the mean activation vector from the residual stream before adding the steering vector. The mean vector is computed from the same training set used to create the steering vector. This approach should help remove common activation patterns and emphasize the unique aspects of the steering vector.

## Run 2: Test Set Demeaning
Results: Pending
Description: Instead of using the training set mean for demeaning, we compute the mean activation from the test set. This approach might better capture the general activation patterns in the context where we're applying the steering vector, potentially leading to more effective steering.

## Run 3: Scaled Mean Vector Demeaning
Results: Pending
Description: Building on Run 2, we experiment with different scaling factors (0.5, 1.0, 1.5) for the mean vector before subtracting it from the residual stream. This allows us to control how much of the common activation patterns we remove, potentially finding an optimal balance between preserving useful information and removing noise.

## Run 4: Pre-Demeaned Steering Vector
Results: Pending
Description: Instead of demeaning the residual stream at runtime, we demean the steering vector itself before applying it. This approach might be more computationally efficient and could lead to different results as it modifies the steering vector directly rather than the model's activations during inference.
